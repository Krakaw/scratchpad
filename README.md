> Deploy &#34;scratch&#34; environments easily

### âœ¨ [Scratchpad](https://github.com/Krakaw/scratchpad)

## Install

```sh
git clone git@github.com:Krakaw/scratchpad.git
```

## Usage

```sh
cp .controller.env.sample .controller.env
cp controller/.pg.env.sample controller/.pg.env
./start.sh
```

## What's Happening

1. `start.sh` will start the controller docker container that has a node.js web server that controls the rest of the docker containers.
2. The `controller` docker has access to `docker.sock` so it can spin up the main environment (pg, redis, mockchain) as well as turn on and off the scratches.
3. Each scratch gets its own copy of the `templates/.*.env` and symlinked the other control files.
4. Each scratch has a unix socket that the nginx container proxies all traffic through.
5. Either expose the nginx container port and update the server_name fields in nginx.conf or proxy an SSL connection from another nginx instance.

## Unix Sockets

1. Adding a new docker image that binds a volume and creates 3 socket files
2. The socat image in the docker-compose.yml can use the socat-to-scp.sh script to forward traffic to the container
3. The host nginx can use the uri either `*`.example.com or example.com/`*` depending on the ssl setup to know which socket to proxy to
